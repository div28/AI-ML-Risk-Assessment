## Executive Summary
The **{project}** system has been classified as **{overall_risk} RISK** based on {impact.lower()} impact and {probability.lower()} probability assessments. This AI-powered analysis identifies critical areas requiring immediate attention to ensure regulatory compliance and operational security.

## Project Overview
- **System Description:** {description}
- **Operating Context:** {context}
- **Assessment Date:** {time.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}
- **Overall Risk Level:** **{overall_risk}**

## Risk Classification & Analysis

### Primary Risk Categories Identified:
{chr(10).join([f"- **{cat}**" for cat in risk_categories])}

### Detailed Risk Assessment:

#### ðŸ”´ Critical Risks:
{chr(10).join([f"- {risk}" for risk in technical_risks[:2]])}

#### ðŸŸ¡ Compliance Risks:
{chr(10).join([f"- {risk}" for risk in compliance_risks])}

#### ðŸŸ  Operational Risks:
{chr(10).join([f"- {risk}" for risk in operational_risks])}

## Risk Impact Analysis
- **Probability:** {probability} - Based on system design and data handling patterns
- **Impact:** {impact} - Considering regulatory environment and data sensitivity
- **Risk Score:** {risk_score}/7 ({overall_risk})

## Recommended Mitigation Strategies

{chr(10).join([f'''### {i+1}. {mit["strategy"]}
- **Implementation Timeline:** {mit["timeline"]}
- **Priority Level:** {mit["priority"]}
- **Expected Outcome:** Significant reduction in associated risk exposure
''' for i, mit in enumerate(mitigations)])}

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0-2 weeks)
- Conduct security audit of current data handling practices
- Implement access controls and authentication measures
- Begin compliance documentation review

### Phase 2: Core Mitigations (2-8 weeks)
- Deploy primary mitigation strategies identified above
- Establish monitoring and alerting systems
- Create incident response procedures

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (8+ weeks)
- Regular risk assessments and updates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Stakeholder training and awareness programs

## Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Zero** data breach incidents
- **100%** compliance audit pass rate
- **<24 hour** incident response time
- **Quarterly** risk assessment reviews completed

## Regulatory Considerations
{"- **GDPR Compliance:** Critical for EU operations with personal data processing" if "eu" in context_lower or "gdpr" in context_lower else ""}
{"- **Data Protection:** Enhanced security measures required for sensitive information" if "sensitive" in desc_lower else ""}

## Next Steps & Recommendations
1. **Executive Review:** Present findings to leadership team within 48 hours
2. **Resource Allocation:** Assign dedicated team for mitigation implementation  
3. **Timeline Approval:** Secure approval for recommended implementation timeline
4. **Monitoring Setup:** Establish ongoing risk monitoring processes

---

**Assessment Methodology:** AI-powered multi-agent analysis  
**Confidence Level:** High (based on comprehensive input analysis)  
**Review Frequency:** Recommended quarterly or upon system changes

## Executive Summary
The {project_name} system presents **{initial_impact.lower()} impact** and **{initial_probability.lower()} probability** risks that require immediate attention. {risk_description}

## Key Risk Areas Identified
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Handling sensitive information
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting industry standards  
- **Operational Risk**: System reliability and performance
- **Reputational Risk**: Impact on organizational trust

## Context Analysis
{contextual_notes}

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Implement security controls and access management
2. **Short-term**: Establish monitoring and compliance frameworks
3. **Long-term**: Continuous improvement and risk assessment processes

## Implementation Priority
- **Critical**: Data protection measures
- **High**: Compliance documentation
- **Medium**: Performance optimization
- **Low**: Advanced analytics and reporting
